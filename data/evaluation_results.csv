Student-athletes are not to transport other student athletes in private vehicles once the students have reported for an official University activity/function. Once the student has reported, official university transportation needs to be supplied by employees and other university-approved drivers or commercial drivers. This directive means it is inappropriate to ask a student-athlete, in his/her own car, to transport others', 'means it is inappropriate to ask a student-athlete, in his/her own car, to transport others (1) to the airport when departing for an away competition, or (2) to an alternative practice site after reporting to a central location.']","No, it is not appropriate for student-athletes to transport others using their own vehicles once they have reported for an official University activity/function. They must use the official university or approved commercial transports instead. This policy likely extends to driving other students to away games as well, so doing so in a personal car would be against regulations outlined by your context. I cannot find specific information about airport transportation but based on general guidelsofthe provided policies it can reasonably assumed that this rule also applies there too; hence they should not drive others' cars to the airport for away games either.","No, student-athletes are not to transport other student-athletes in private vehicles once they have reported for an official University activity/function.",1,0.2857142857,0.7010625004

For overnight trips, drivers must be afforded their own hotel room and per federal law they are to be unreachable (e.g. their cell phone is turned off) for the duration of their mandated off time. If these requirements will affect your trip, they must be budgeted for accordingly.']","Yes, according to policy b., if there is an overnight travel aspect of any transportation used by the team (which can include both school and potentially third-party companies), then a separate single room must be reserved for the bus driver. This requirement aligns with federal law as well that mandates drivers on such trips should have their own hotel accommodations where they are to remain unreachable during off time, effectively turning their cell phone(s) off or otherwise ensdicting them from contact while rested at these facilities.","Yes, if there is overnight travel, a separate single room must be reserved for the bus driver.",1,0.8571428571,0.5719122828
